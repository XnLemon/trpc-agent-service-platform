# Issue #82: Agent App Registry, tenant canary, and rollback

> This page is the document-first contract for [Issue #82](https://github.com/XnLemon/trpc-agent-service/issues/82). It builds on the existing immutable execution plan, reference-counted `RunnerRegistry`, and Admin control plane. Code must not claim a distributed registry or a platform-wide traffic manager.

## Goal and boundary

One deployed tRPC instance owns an isolated control-plane namespace and materializes tenant Agent Apps locally. The platform may govern multiple instances, but instance registration, placement, and cross-instance broadcast are outside this issue. Within an instance, an Agent App selects one stable published revision and may select one candidate published revision for its own tenant.

Platform control plane (future instance placement)
  -> tRPC instance
       -> tenant
            -> Agent App
                 -> current revision (stable)
                 -> canary revision (optional candidate)
                      -> immutable ExecutionPlan
                           -> reference-counted Runner lease

Issue #82 delivers only the instance-local App Registry behavior: revision selection, exact Runner reuse, lease-safe invalidation, tenant-authorized canary configuration, durable rollback, and auditable decisions. It does not add percentage, user, session, or hash-based routing; a selected tenant receives the candidate revision for every new execution of that App. It does not execute tenant-supplied code, add a distributed cache, or implement the Tool/Guardrail policy chain planned for Issue #78.

## Existing baseline

`runtime.ExecutionPlan.CacheKey()` already contains the tenant, App, revision, content digest, and resolved Model/Backend versions. `gateway.RunnerRegistry` owns runners by that complete key, combines concurrent construction, and keeps invalidated runners alive until the last lease releases. `agent.Repository` already persists immutable published revisions and atomically moves `current_revision` for publish and rollback.

The new contract must preserve those properties. A canary must choose a different immutable plan; it must never mutate a cached runner or evict an in-flight lease.

## App selection state

`agent.App` gains an optional `CanaryRevision` field alongside `CurrentRevision`. Both fields refer to a published revision in the same `(tenant_id, app_id)` scope. The following invariants are mandatory:

- `CurrentRevision` remains the stable/default revision and is required for an active App.
- A non-nil `CanaryRevision` is distinct from `CurrentRevision`, positive, and points to a published revision.
- Only an active Tenant and active App can start, change, promote, or clear a canary.
- Tenant scope, App scope, and revision scope are checked by the repository; an Admin request body cannot override its authenticated tenant scope.
- A suspended or disabled App admits no new execution, even if it retains revision pointers for history.
- Existing published revisions are never changed, copied, or renumbered.

The PostgreSQL migration adds nullable `canary_revision` to `agent_app`, a same-App foreign key, and a trigger that rejects references to draft revisions or a candidate equal to `current_revision`. In-memory and PostgreSQL repositories expose the same validation and optimistic-lock behavior. Existing rows receive `NULL`, so they retain the old stable-only behavior.

## Authorized changes and rollback

The repository adds one explicit operation:

~~~go
SetCanary(context.Context, SetCanaryInput) (*App, ChangeEvent, error)
~~~

`SetCanaryInput` contains the explicit tenant/App scope, expected App version, an optional candidate revision, trusted tenant-active gate, and mandatory actor/reason/correlation metadata. A non-nil candidate starts or replaces the canary; `nil` stops it. The Admin endpoint uses the existing administrator authenticator and tenant-scope check:

~~~text
POST /admin/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/apps/{app_id}/canary
{
  "expected_app_version": 7,
  "candidate_revision": 13,
  "reason": "tenant rollout",
  "correlation_id": "rollout-2026-08-27"
}
~~~

An omitted or JSON `null` `candidate_revision` clears the canary. The route returns the updated App and a control-plane change event. A non-admin caller is rejected before repository access; a scoped administrator cannot configure another tenant.

`Rollback` continues to atomically move `CurrentRevision` to a historical published revision. It clears `CanaryRevision` in the same update, so rollback restores one selected stable runtime plan for all future executions. Rolling back to the candidate revision therefore promotes it; rolling back to the former stable revision terminates the rollout. In either case, a post-commit App invalidation removes only future runner entries for that tenant/App.

## Deterministic runtime behavior

`PlanResolver` chooses `CanaryRevision` when it is set; otherwise it chooses `CurrentRevision`. Both choices originate exclusively in the persisted App snapshot, never in an HTTP header, request body, channel payload, user ID, or client-provided revision. Thus selection is deterministic for the tenant/App pair without a percentage hash or an unauditable fallback.

The resolver loads and validates the selected published revision before constructing `ExecutionPlan`. A candidate and stable revision naturally produce different complete cache keys. The existing registry then guarantees:

1. same selected key reuses a local Runner;
2. different tenant, App, revision, or dependency version cannot share a Runner;
3. a canary mutation or rollback invalidates only future entries for the affected App;
4. an already acquired lease keeps its frozen Runner until `Release`; and
5. a restart reloads selection state from PostgreSQL before accepting traffic.

## Audit facts

Every canary configuration mutation produces an `agent.ChangeEvent` with the existing trusted actor, reason, correlation ID, version transition, and selected revision metadata. The durable control-plane outbox adds explicit `canary_started` and `canary_stopped` event types.

For every execution selected through the candidate pointer, Gateway writes an `audit.EventCanarySelected` fact before the normal execution-started fact. It records only tenant, App, chosen revision, request/trace correlation, and the stable audit fields; it never stores request text, identity secrets, provider endpoints, or credentials. The normal execution facts already preserve the actual revision, so a restart or later analysis can join every request to its immutable App definition.

## Compatibility and lifecycle

- Existing App rows, callers, API clients, and stable-only execution retain their behavior because the canary pointer defaults to `nil`.
- Existing `Publish`, status transitions, cache keys, and lease API remain source-compatible.
- New public inputs follow existing `context.Context`-first repository methods and return existing sentinel error classes (`agent.ErrInvalid`, `agent.ErrConflict`, `agent.ErrDisabled`, and `agent.ErrNotFound`).
- No goroutine, channel, or timer is introduced for canary selection. The existing Registry remains the single owner of runner lifecycle and bounded close.
- Future percentage or per-user rollout requires a separate contract with a versioned stable bucketing key; it must not overload this tenant-wide selection field.

## Issue ledger and verification

- [x] Add a durable App candidate-revision pointer with PostgreSQL migration, repository support, and a tenant-authorized Admin operation.
- [x] Resolve an immutable candidate plan when configured, otherwise preserve stable-plan resolution and exact complete-key Runner reuse.
- [x] Invalidate only future tenant/App entries for canary changes and rollback; in-flight leases complete on their frozen revision.
- [x] Append durable control-plane canary facts and per-execution candidate-selection audit facts without exposing sensitive data.
- [x] Prove tenant isolation, optimistic conflicts, candidate validation, publish/promotion/rollback, in-flight leases, restart recovery, and stable-only compatibility with contract tests.
- [x] Update the README and documentation navigation after the implemented behavior was covered by tests.

Implementation validation will run focused Agent, Gateway, Admin, Bootstrap, migration, and audit tests first, then `go test ./... -count=1`, `go test -race ./... -count=1`, `go vet ./...`, formatting, and strict MkDocs build when their local dependencies are available.
